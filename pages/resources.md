##Resources
The OpenDirect API is a RESTful API that supports JSON. This section defines the JSON resource objects used by the API. For a diagram that shows the relationships between these resources, see Resource Model.

For a list of URIs that use these resources, see URIs.

###Account
Defines an Account resource. An Account associates an advertiser with a buyer. A buyer is typically an agency but may also be the advertiser. A buyer may be associated with one or more advertisers and an advertiser may be associated with one or more buyers.

Before an agency may create accounts and perform buys on behalf of the advertiser, the advertiser must give permissions to the agency. The process of giving or removing permissions is publisher defined. Creating an account must fail if the advertiser has not given the agency permissions.

The Account owns the orders and creatives.

| Weight       | Byte   | Numeric value from 1 through 100. | Optional  | Optional  | Should support        | Determines how much the creative is displayed relative to the other creatives assigned to the same line. To provide even rotation, do not specify a weight. If weight is specified, all assignments that specify the same line must specify a weight and the weight of all the assignments must add up to 100.  If the weight of all assignments does not add up to 100, even rotation is applied. Assignments with heavier weight get proportionally more rotation compared to those with lesser weight. For example, if the line has 2 creatives, A and B, assigned with the same dates, and A has weight 25 and B has weight 75, B will serve three times as often as A. |

Notes: The assignment must fail if the following are true.

  - The language of the creative does not match the language of the product (the line identifies the product).
  - The specified maturity level of the creative does not match the maturity level of the product specified by the line.

A creative must be assigned to a line before the line may be booked.

To change the creative assigned to a line, first assign a new creative to the line to ensure that the line continues to deliver and then use the disable verb to set the current assignment to Inactive.

To display different creatives at different times, add a line for each creative. If weighting is used, providers should indicate in the user interface whether all assignments for a line specify a weight and that the sum of all weights is 100.

###Creative
Defines a Creative resource. The Creative provides information about an ad.

To assign a creative to a line, see Assignment.
