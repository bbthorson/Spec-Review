##Versioning

Versioning occurs at the API level and is URI based. All services that make up the API must use the same version number. The version may fall anywhere in the path before the resource and must have the form vn, where n is a positive integer. For example, in the URI https://<host>/api/v1/accounts/{id}, v1 indicates version 1 of the API.
